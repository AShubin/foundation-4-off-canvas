foundation-4-off-canvas
=======================

####A simple off-canvas navigation for Foundation [4].

This is a simple proof of concept application using Tom Rich's [Super simple off-canvas navigation](//blog.tomri.ch/super-simple-off-canvas-menu-navigation/) example. The need arises for Foundation 4 users in particular, since there's off-canvas functionality in Foundation 3 & 5, but not version 4.

Joey at Cheeky Monkey Media wrote up another, more advanced method, which includes incorporating the off-canvas nav functionality in a Drupal theme - awesome. Joey's example can be found here: [Off Canvas Menu in Zurb Foundation 4 - Drupal Theme Integration](//cheekymonkeymedia.ca/blog/web-development/canvas-menu-zurb-foundation-4-drupal-theme-integration).
